Parthenon: A Performance Portable Block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Framework
=====================================================================================

`Parthenon`_ is a performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework.

.. _Parthenon: https://github.com/parthenon-hpc-lab/parthenon

Key Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Device first/device resident approach (work data only in device memory to prevent expensive transfers between host and device)
* Transparent packing of data across blocks (to reduce/hide kernel launch latency)
* Direct device-to-device communication via asynchronous, one-sided  MPI communication
* Intermediate abstraction layer to hide complexity of device kernel launches
* Flexible, plug-in package system
* Abstract variables controlled via metadata flags
* Support for particles
* Multi-stage drivers/integrators with support for task-based parallelism
