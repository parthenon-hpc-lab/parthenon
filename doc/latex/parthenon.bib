Those methods are based on a two-step process where a 3D frame field is built by assigning a frame to each cell of a tetrahedral mesh, then a parametrization algorithm is applied to generate a hexahedral mesh. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to generate block-structured hexahedral meshes for any CAD domain Ω. This work differs from previous ones in several points: (1) the proposed approach does not start from a pre-meshed boundary; (2) The frame field initialization does not put singularity lines around the medial object of Ω; (3) Frames are assigned to the vertices and not to the cells of the tetrahedral mesh; (4) We do not perform a parametrization process but we generate a block structure that partition Ω in meshable regions.}

abstract = {Many algorithms in computer graphics and geometry processing use two orthogonal smooth direction fields (unit tangent vector fields) defined over a surface. For instance, these direction fields are used in texture synthesis, in geometry processing or in nonphotorealistic rendering to distribute and orient elements on the surface. Such direction fields can be designed in fundamentally different ways, according to the symmetry requested: inverting a direction or swapping two directions might be allowed or not.Despite the advances realized in the last few years in the domain of geometry processing, a unified formalism is still lacking for the mathematical object that characterizes these generalized direction fields. As a consequence, existing direction field design algorithms are limited to using nonoptimum local relaxation procedures.In this article, we formalize N-symmetry direction fields, a generalization of classical direction fields. We give a new definition of their singularities to explain how they relate to the topology of the surface. Specifically, we provide an accessible demonstration of the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem in the case of N-symmetry direction fields on 2-manifolds. Based on this theorem, we explain how to control the topology of N-symmetry direction fields on meshes. We demonstrate the validity and robustness of this formalism by deriving a highly efficient algorithm to design a smooth field interpolating user-defined singularities and directions.},

abstract = {A basic challenge in field-guided hexahedral meshing is to find a spatially-varying frame that is adapted to the domain geometry and is continuous up to symmetries of the cube. We introduce a fundamentally new representation of such 3D cross fields based on Cartan's method of moving frames. Our key observation is that cross fields and ordinary frame fields are locally characterized by identical conditions on their Darboux derivative. Hence, by using derivatives as the principal representation (and only later recovering the field itself), one avoids the need to explicitly account for symmetry during optimization. At the discrete level, derivatives are encoded by skew-symmetric matrices associated with the edges of a tetrahedral mesh; these matrices encode arbitrarily large rotations along each edge, and can robustly capture singular behavior even on coarse meshes. We apply this representation to compute 3D cross fields that are as smooth as possible everywhere but on a prescribed network of singular curves---since these fields are adapted to curve tangents, they can be directly used as input for field-guided mesh generation algorithms. Optimization amounts to an easy nonlinear least squares problem that behaves like a convex program in the sense that it always appears to produce the same result, independent of initialization. We study the numerical behavior of this procedure, and perform some preliminary experiments with mesh generation.},

abstract = {Despite high practical demand, algorithmic hexahedral meshing with guarantees on robustness and quality remains unsolved. A promising direction follows the idea of integer-grid maps, which pull back the Cartesian hexahedral grid formed by integer isoplanes from a parametric domain to a surface-conforming hexahedral mesh of the input object. Since directly optimizing for a high-quality integer-grid map is mathematically challenging, the construction is usually split into two steps: (1) generation of a surface-aligned octahedral field and (2) generation of an integer-grid map that best aligns to the octahedral field. The main robustness issue stems from the fact that smooth octahedral fields frequently exhibit singularity graphs that are not appropriate for hexahedral meshing and induce heavily degenerate integer-grid maps. The first contribution of this work is an enumeration of all local configurations that exist in hex meshes with bounded edge valence, and a generalization of the Hopf-Poincar\'{e} formula to octahedral fields, leading to necessary local and global conditions for the hex-meshability of an octahedral field in terms of its singularity graph. The second contribution is a novel algorithm to generate octahedral fields with prescribed hex-meshable singularity graphs, which requires the solution of a large nonlinear mixed-integer algebraic system. This algorithm is an important step toward robust automatic hexahedral meshing since it enables the generation of a hex-meshable octahedral field.},

abstract = {Quadrilateral remeshing approaches based on global parametrization enable many desirable mesh properties. Two of the most important ones are (1) high regularity due to explicit control over irregular vertices and (2) smooth distribution of distortion achieved by convex variational formulations. Apart from these strengths, state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limited reliability on real-world input data, i.e. the determined map might have degeneracies like (local) non-injectivities and consequently often cannot be used directly to generate a quadrilateral mesh. In this paper we propose a novel convex Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) formulation which ensures by construction that the resulting map is within the class of so called Integer-Grid Maps that are guaranteed to imply a quad mesh. In order to overcome the NP-hardness of MIQP and to be able to remesh typical input geometries in acceptable time we propose two additional problem specific optimizations: a complexity reduction algorithm and singularity separating conditions. While the former decouples the dimension of the MIQP search space from the input complexity of the triangle mesh and thus is able to dramatically speed up the computation without inducing inaccuracies, the latter improves the continuous relaxation, which is crucial for the success of modern MIQP optimizers. Our experiments show that the reliability of the resulting algorithm does not only annihilate the main drawback of parametrization based quad-remeshing but moreover enables the global search for high-quality coarse quad layouts - a difficult task solely tackled by greedy methodologies before.},

abstract = {Abstract We introduce an algorithm for the automatic computation of global parameterizations on arbitrary simplicial 2-manifolds, whose parameter lines are guided by a given frame field, for example, by principal curvature frames. The parameter lines are globally continuous and allow a remeshing of the surface into quadrilaterals. The algorithm converts a given frame field into a single vector field on a branched covering of the 2-manifold and generates an integrable vector field by a Hodge decomposition on the covering space. Except for an optional smoothing and alignment of the initial frame field, the algorithm is fully automatic and generates high quality quadrilateral meshes.},

abstract = {Abstract Computer-oriented mesh generators, which serve as pre-processors to finite element programs, have recently been developed by several investigators to alleviate the frustration and to reduce the amount of time involved in the tedious manual subdividing of a complex structure into finite elements. Our purpose here is to describe how the techniques of bivariate ‘blending-function’ interpolation, which were originally developed for, and applied to, geometric problems of computer-aided design and numerically controlled machining of free-form surfaces such as automobile exterior panels, can be adapted and applied to the problems of mesh generation for finite element analyses. We concentrate attention on the problem of curvilinearly co-ordinating simply connected planar domains ℛ by constructing invertible maps of the unit square �� [0, 1] × [0, 1] onto ℛ. Extensions of the methods described herein to shells in 3-space is straightforward and is illustrated by a practical example taken from the automobile industry. Analogous mesh generators for three-dimensional solids can be developed on the basis of the trivariate ‘blending-function’ formulae found at the end of the second section.},

abstract = {A new gridding technique for the solution of partial differential equations in spherical geometry is presented. The method is based on a decomposition of the sphere into six identical regions, obtained by projecting the sides of a circumscribed cube onto a spherical surface. By choosing the coordinate lines on each region to be arcs of great circles, one obtains six coordinate systems which are free of any singularity and define the same metric. Taking full advantage of the symmetry properties of the decomposition, a variation of the composite mesh finite difference method can be applied to couple the six grids and obtain, with a high degree of efficiency, very accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations on the sphere. The advantages of this new technique over both spectral and uniform longitude–latitude grid point methods are discussed in the context of applications on serial and parallel architectures. We present results of two test cases for numerical approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry: the linear advection of a cosine bell and the nonlinear evolution of a Rossby–Haurwitz wave. Performance analysis for this latter case indicates that the new method can provide, with substantial savings in execution times, numerical solutions which are as accurate as those obtainable with the spectral transform method.}

abstract = {This paper presents the development and implementation of weighted-essentially-non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes for viscous flows on arbitrary unstructured grids. WENO schemes up to fifth-order accurate have been implemented in conjunction with hybrid and non-hybrid unstructured grids. The schemes are investigated with reference to numerical and experimental results for the Taylor–Green vortex, as well as for laminar and turbulent flows around a sphere, and the turbulent shock-wave boundary layer interaction flow problem. The results show that the accuracy of the schemes depends on the arbitrariness of shape and orientation of the unstructured mesh elements, as well as the compactness of directional stencils. The WENO schemes provide a more accurate numerical framework compared to second-order and third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) methods, however, the fifth-order version of the schemes is computationally too expensive to make the schemes practically usable. On the other hand, the third-order variant offers an excellent numerical framework in terms of accuracy and computational cost compared to the fifth-order WENO and second-order TVD schemes. Parallelisation of the CFD code (henceforth labelled as UCNS3D), where the schemes have been implemented, shows that the present methods offer very good scalable performance.}

Comput. Phys. 193 (2003) 115]. In this paper, we extend the method to solve two dimensional non-linear hyperbolic conservation law systems. The emphasis is again on the application of such HWENO finite volume methodology as limiters for RKDG methods to maintain compactness of RKDG methods. Numerical experiments for two dimensional Burgers’ equation and Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics are presented to show the effectiveness of these methods.}

abstract = {In this paper we conduct a research on the multidimensional fifth-order reconstruction method for Balsara's genuinely two-dimensional (2D) HLLE Riemann solver. This solver possesses the multidimensional effect successfully by solving the 2D Riemann problem at the cell vertexes. However, it is difficult to be applied to higher-order reconstruction technology. In order to meet the requirement of the reconstruction of the variables at the vertexes, we construct the general WENO reconstruction formula to complete the reconstruction procedure along different spatial directions in turns. The Gaussian quadrature is employed to achieve the fifth-order accuracy of the numerical flux integration at the interface. Typical Simpson rule in Balsara's 2D HLLE solver is no longer used, and each Gaussian point is regarded as an independent 2D Riemann problem to obtain the 2D Riemann flux directly. Due to the inevitable numerical overshoots in the process of the fifth-order reconstruction, an accuracy-preserving limiter is introduced to enhance the computational stability, which could maintain the numerical accuracy in the smooth regions and suppress the overshoots near discontinuities. Solution accuracy tests show that the multidimensional WENO method could achieve the fifth-order accuracy. Several solution quality tests are also presented, which indicate that the method proposed in this study performs well in all test cases and can capture discontinuities and complex flow structures accurately and efficiently.}
