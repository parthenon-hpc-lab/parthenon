// This is a variadic template class that accepts any set of types
// and is always equal to void as long as the types are well formed.
// Although it seems simple, it is the basis of the SFINAE "void_t
// trick" from Walter Brown. Probably just easiest to google it for
// a better description than I can give, there are some nice talks
// by Walter Brown about it on YouTube.

template <class... Ts>
using void_t = void;

// implements is a template struct for checking if type T implements a particular
// concept, which here simply means that it conforms to some interface.
// (I think people call this concepts lite, since there are more
// powerful things that concepts can do in C++20 and the compiler error
// messages from this type of implementation can be kind of crazy). This cleaner
// interface for using the void_t trick is partly inspired by Stackoverflow 26513095

// General template that is accepted if the specialization below
// is not well formed, inherits from false type so that implements<...>()
// will return false. The default parameter for the second template argument
// means that when you write implements<T>, the compiler inteprets this as
// implements<T, void> and then looks to see if there is a specialization that
// matches this pattern

template <class T, class = void>
struct implements : std::false_type {};

// Specialization of implements that is chosen if all of the template
// arguments to void_t are well formed, since in that case void_t = void
// and this specialization matches the defined template pattern. Note that
// pattern Concept(Ts...) is interpreted as a function taking types Ts...
// and returning type Concept, but such a function doesn't get used for anything
// we are doing. It is just a clean way of deducing multiple types from a single
// input type Concept(Ts...) to the base template.

template <class Concept, class... Ts>
struct implements<Concept(Ts...), void_t<decltype(std::declval<Concept>().requires_(
                                      std::declval<Ts>()...))>> : std::true_type {};

//---------------------------
// Various concepts are implemented below. The general useage of a
// concept would be:
//
// template<class T, REQUIRES(implements<my_concept(T)>::value)>
// void foo(T& in){ implementation when T conforms to my_concept}
//
// template<class T, REQUIRES(!implements<my_concept(T)>::value)>
// void foo(T& in){ implementation when T doesn't conform to my_concept}
//
// Strangely, for some compilers, replacing implements<my_concept(T)>::value
// with implements<my_concept(T)>() causes the code not to compile, so
// we use value everywhere even though it is slightly more verbose.
//---------------------------

// Concept for a general container, not necessarily with
// contiguous data storage
struct container {
  // Every concept needs a requires_ method declaration, no 
  // implementation of requires_ is necessary though.
  // requires_ should be well formed if the object T matches the
  // concept of the struct (in this case a contiguous container).
  // We just use void_t here since it is a variadic template that
  // can accept any number of types and we don't care about the
  // actual return type of requires_. Of course for it to be specialized,
  // all of the type parameters should be well formed. Including
  // the typename in front of the member type is important, since if
  // it is not included T::value_type will not be interpreted as a
  // type even if exists in T, void_t<...> will not be well formed
  // since it only accepts types, the definition of requires_ will
  // fail silently, implements<contiguous_container(T)> will always
  // inherit from false_type (even if T is a contiguous container),
  // and you will be left wondering what the hell is going on.
