Application Drivers
===================

Parthenon provides some basic functionality for coordinating various
types of calculation in the form of the ``Driver`` class and others that
derive from it.

Driver
------

``Driver`` is an abstract base class that owns pointers to a
``ParameterInput`` object, a ``Mesh`` object, and an ``Outputs`` object.
It has a single pure virtual member function called ``Execute`` that
must be defined by a derived class and is intended to be called from
``main()``. A simple example of defining an application based on
inheriting from this class can be found
`here <https://github.com/parthenon-hpc-lab/parthenon/blob/develop/example/calculate_pi/pi_driver.hpp>`__.

EvolutionDriver
---------------

The ``EvolutionDriver`` class derives from ``Driver``, defining the
``Execute`` function to carry out the

.. code:: cpp

   while (t < tmax) {
       // step the solution through time
   }

loop, including periodic outputs. It has a single pure virtual member
function called ``Step`` which a derived class must define and which
will be called during each pass of the loop above. The
``SetGlobalTimeStep`` and ``OutputCycleDiagnostics`` functions have
default implementations, but can be overridden for flexibility.

MultiStageDriver
----------------

The ``MultiStageDriver`` derives from the ``EvolutionDriver``, extending
it in two important ways. First, it is templated on an ``Integrator`` type and
holds a ``std::unique_ptr<Integrator>`` object which includes members for
the number of stages, the stage weights, and the names of the stages.
More details on integrators can be found on the :ref:`integrators` page.
Second, it defines a ``Step()`` function, which is reponsible for taking
a timestep by looping over stages and calling the
``ConstructAndExecuteTaskLists`` function which builds and executes the
tasks for each stage. Applications that derive from ``MultiStageDriver``
are responsible for defining a ``MakeTaskCollection`` function that
makes a ``TaskCollection`` given a ``BlockList_t &`` and an integer
stage. The advection example
(`here <https://github.com/parthenon-hpc-lab/parthenon/blob/develop/example/advection/advection_driver.hpp>`__) demonstrates the
use of this capability.

MultiStageBlockTaskDriver
-------------------------

The ``MultiStageBlockTaskDriver`` derives from the ``MultiStageDriver``,
providing a slightly different interface to downstream codes.
Application drivers that derive from this class must define a
``MakeTaskList`` function that builds a task list for a given
``MeshBlock *`` and integer stage. This is less flexible than the
``MultiStageDriver``, but does simplify the code necessary to stand up a
new capability.

PreExecute/PostExecute
----------------------

The ``Driver`` class defines two virtual void member functions,
``PreExecute`` and ``PostExecute``, that provide simple reporting
including timing data for the application. Application drivers that
derive from ``Driver`` are intended to call these functions at the
beginning and end of their ``Execute`` function if such reporting is
desired. In addition, applications can extend these capabilities as
desired, as demonstrated in the example
`here <https://github.com/parthenon-hpc-lab/parthenon/blob/develop/example/calculate_pi/pi_driver.cpp>`__.

The ``EvolutionDriver``, which already defines the ``Execute`` function,
extends the ``PostExecute`` function with additional reporting and calls
both methods.
